# User Story
## Basic Employee On-Boarding

# Requirements
We need a system to collect basic employee information for the purposes of bringing a new employee into the company. The system must collect the following important information:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Optional Title (Dr., etc.)
- Phone Number
- Home Address
- Shirt Size
- Hat Size
- SSN with correct formatting
- DOB

A future user story will facilitate the storing of the data to a server. For now collect and display the information back to the user. We need to allow for inserting and editing multiple users.

# Stretch Goals
- Validate the data before allowing a submit
- Provide the Shirt and Hat size as drop down lists
- Ensure code is reusable in other parts of the application
- Use a date picker for the DOB
- Format the DOB with the M/D/Y style

# Required Technology
- Angular 2+
- TypeScript
- Git

# Code Access
All code must be committed to a git repository and pushed to a public host for review. Possible hosts are [GitHub](http://github.com) or [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.com).
